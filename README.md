# Find_knn
This is a project for the class Parallel-and-Distributed-Systems that finds the knn.
There are two aproaches a simple Sequential and a more complex Asynchronous parallel using OpenMPI

# Compile 

After downloading the files go to the folder "=====" and use make.
This will compile both the Sequential and the Asynchronous parallel versions and will produce two executables.

# Run the Sequential

Use make run 


run runmpi clean test runssh

# Load files
